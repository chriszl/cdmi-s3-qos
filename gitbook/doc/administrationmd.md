# Deployment and Administration

This chapter describes how to install, configure and run cdmi-s3-qos module as a part of cdmi-qos server (sometimes refered to as cdmi-qos service). It means that you need to have already installed cdmi-qos server and now you are extending it with cdmi-s3-qos module. The presence of already configured back-end CEPH cluster and RADOSGW module is also presumed.
